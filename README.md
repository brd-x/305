Identifying software security vulnerabilities involves both manually checking code and creating a dependency report.
Especially with programs like Artemis Financial which stores sensitive user data, making your code secure and following standard guidelines help prevent hacking attacks.
A company that implements maximum software security lets customers know they can trust a company with their information.
The vulnerability assessment helped me understand the company's goal better.
I approached the need to implement better security by following better code practices, as well as removing dependancies that have known vulnerabilities.
Every time you make a major change to code by introducing new plugins, you need to run a dependency check to ensure no new vulnerabilities have been created.
If I were to show my skills learned in this class to an employer, I would show my proficiency in creating and understand dependency checks.
